# Next Steps
After learning the basics, you can continue improving your Git skills by exploring:
- Branches
- Pull requests
- Collaborating with others (and specific commands with that)
- Resolving merge conflicts

Git is a valuable skill that improves with regular practice, just like anything else.
Anyone interested in working in the IT/CS field must become familiar with version control systems. They are the backbone of the modern-day tech development industry.
