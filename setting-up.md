# Setting Up Git and GitHub

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Account
Go to github.com and create a free account using your email.

## Step 2: Install Git
Download Git from https://git-scm.com and follow the installer instructions.
Some operating systems come with Git pre-installed, but it is only a wrapper that prompts a proper full installation instead. 

## Step 3: Configure Git
Open a terminal and run:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@email.com"
```

This assigns your account as the user for all repositories being accessed on your device. (hence the --global)
