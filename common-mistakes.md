# Common Beginner Mistakes
Learning Git can feel confusing at first. These are some common mistakes beginners make when learning how to navigate this system.

## Forgetting to Stage/Commit Files
Files must be added before they can be committed. You cannot "push" (send files to the online repository) when you have nothing staged. 

## Writing Unclear Commit Messages
Commit messages should briefly describe what changed. This promotes good communication and limits the need for backchanneling. 
This is especially important since software development is a highly collaborative field.

## Making Too Many Changes in One Commit
Small commits are easier to understand and undo.
When you commit too many things at once, it's hard to tell where things went wrong (and they will almost always go wrong).

## Panic When Something Goes Wrong
Git stores history. Most mistakes can be fixed.
If something doesn't work out, take a breath and remind yourself that it's okay, you can always just go back to a previous commit version and restore your old code.
